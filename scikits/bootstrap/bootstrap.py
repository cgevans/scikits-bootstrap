    """
Given a set of data ``data``, and a statistics function ``statfunction`` that
applies to that data, computes the bootstrap confidence interval for
``statfunction`` on that data. Data points are assumed to be delineated by
axis 0.

Parameters
----------
data: array_like, shape (N, ...)
    Input data. Data points are assumed to be delineated by axis 0. Beyond this,
    the shape doesn't matter, so long as ``statfunction`` can be applied to the
    array.
statfunction: function
    This function should accept samples of data from ``data``. It is applied
    to these samples individually.
alpha: float or iterable, optional
    The percentiles to use for the confidence interval (default=0.05). If this
    is a float, the returned values are (alpha/2, 1-alpha/2) percentile confidence
    intervals. If it is an iterable, alpha is assumed to be an iterable of
    each desired percentile.
n_samples: float, optional
    The number of bootstrap samples to use (default=10000)
method: string
    The method to use: one of 'pi' or 'bca' (default='bca')

Additional parameters are passed to ``statfunction``.

Returns
-------
confidences: tuple of floats
    The confidence percentiles specified by alpha

Calculation Methods
-------------------
'pi': Percentile Interval (Efron 13.3)
    The percentile interval method simply returns the 100*alphath bootstrap
    sample's values for the statistic.

    This is an extremely simple method of confidence interval calculation.
    However, it has several disadvantages compared to the bias-corrected
    accelerated method, which is the default.
'bca': Bias-Corrected Accelerated Non-Parametric (Efron 14.3) (default)
    This method is much more complex to explain. However, it gives considerably
    better results, and is generally recommended for normal situations. Note
    that in cases where the statistic is smooth, and can be expressed with
    weights, the ABC method will give approximated results much, much faster.
